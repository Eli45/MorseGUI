Idiots Guide to Getting Started:
    1) Make sure you have Java Runtime Environment 6 or greater installed.
        If you don't you can download it at: https://www.java.com/en/
    2A) If you are running Windows: start MorseGUI.bat
    2B) If you are running MacOS or Linux: start MorseGUI.sh
    3) Put text in the 'INPUT' text field located in the upper half of the application.
    4) Press the 'CONFIRM' button.
    5) View pretty contents in 'OUTPUT' text field located in the lower half of the application.
    6) View the 'Full Explanation of Features' section for a better explanation of all possible features.


Full Explanation of Features:
    Place text you wish to translate in the 'INPUT' text field.
    After inputting text you wish to translate, press the 'CONFIRM' button (or press SHIFT+ENTER) to translate the text.
    The newly translated text will appear in the 'OUTPUT' text field.
    Any errors encountered during this translation process will appear at the bottom half of the application and will start with 'ERROR:'.
    Some such errors include:
        Entering unsupported characters into the 'INPUT' field (see SupportedCharacters.txt)

    Pressing the 'SWITCH TRANSLATION MODE' button will switch from translation English->Morse to Morse->English and vice versa.
    Pressing the 'COPY TO CLIPBOARD' button will copy any contents in Output to your clipboard for easy copy pasting.

    Exiting the program follows your standard operating system procedures eg: pressing the exit button in the top right on a Windows machine.

    ADVANCED:
        Providing the program with the command line args '--cmd' will start the program in CLI form, no GUI will be launched.
        Do note that the CLI interface is not checked for exceptions meaning that if an IllegalArgumentException is thrown
        due to invalid characters, your program will crash and burn.
        Only use this if you have a very good reason to.

        Providing the program with the command line args '--test' will start the program in unit testing mode. This will produce a file
        'unit_tests.log' which will contains information pertaining testing if the program is correctly generating output. There should
        be no reason for you to use this unless you are working on this project.
